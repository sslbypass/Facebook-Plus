## 🚀 Installation

Download the pre-built `.ipa` file from the **[Releases](../../releases)** section and install it on your device using **Feather**, **Ksing**, or any other sideloading tool of your choice.

## ⚡ Build your own IPA with GitHub Actions

No Mac required. The **Build Facebook Plus (.ipa)** workflow builds the tweak from
source and injects it into a decrypted Facebook IPA that **you** provide, then
publishes the result as a draft release on your fork.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must supply your own **decrypted** Facebook `.ipa`. We cannot distribute one
> for legal reasons.

**First time only:**

1. **Fork** this repository (top-right **Fork** button).
2. On your fork, open the **Actions** tab and click **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**.

**To build:**

1. If your fork is behind, click **Sync fork → Update branch**.
2. Go to **Actions → Build Facebook Plus (.ipa)**.
3. Click **Run workflow** on the right.
4. Fill in the inputs:
   - **Direct download URL to the decrypted Facebook IPA** — upload your decrypted
     `.ipa` to [**filebin.net**](https://filebin.net) and paste the **direct
     download link** to the file. filebin is the recommended host and the one this
     workflow has been tested with. A link to a *web page* instead of the file
     itself will fail validation.
   - **Bundle identifier** *(optional)* — leave blank to keep `com.facebook.Facebook`.
     Set a custom id to install alongside the stock app. The tweak is
     bundle-id-agnostic, so it activates under whatever id you choose — no other
     change needed.
5. Click **Run workflow** and wait for it to finish (≈10–15 min).
6. Download the IPA from your fork's **Releases** section. The release is created as
   a **draft** — open it, review, and publish. (If you don't see Releases, append
   `/releases` to your fork's URL, e.g. `github.com/<you>/Facebook-Plus/releases`.)

The workflow reuses [`build.sh`](build.sh), so your IPA gets the exact same
injection as a local build — the tweak, the custom app-icons, and the bundled
**Open in Facebook** Safari extension, all fakesigned for sideloading.

## 🛠️ Building from Source & Automated Injection

This project requires [Theos](https://theos.dev) to build. Ensure you have it installed and configured.

1. **Clone the repository** (including submodules):
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/SHAJON-404/Facebook-Plus.git
   cd Facebook-Plus
   ```

2. **Set up Python Environment**:
   Create a virtual environment and install the required tools:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && pipx install --force https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule-rw/archive/main.zip && pipx inject --force cyan lief
   ```

3. **Automated Pipeline (`build.sh`)**:
   - Run `./build.sh` to build **every packaging scheme**, or narrow it with the
     `SCHEMES` variable (e.g. `SCHEMES="rootless rootfull" ./build.sh`).
   - To also produce an injected `.ipa`, place a decrypted Facebook `.ipa` at
     `test/com.facebook.Facebook.ipa` before running.

   **What `build.sh` does:**
   - Builds one versioned `.deb` per scheme into `packages/`:

     | Scheme | Output |
     |---|---|
     | `rootless` | `Facebook-Plus-v<version>-rootless.deb` |
     | `rootfull` | `Facebook-Plus-v<version>-rootfull.deb` |

   - If a decrypted `.ipa` is present, injects the **rootless** build into it with
     `cyan` and writes `packages/Facebook-Plus-v<facebook-version>-rootless.ipa`.
     The same `cyan` run also:
     - builds every Safari web extension under `OpenInFacebookSafariExtension/`
       from source and injects the resulting `.appex` into the app's `PlugIns/`;
     - merges any custom app icons (`fbplus_*.png` in `resources/logo/`) into
       `CFBundleAlternateIcons` via `scripts/icon_plist.py`, preserving
       Facebook's native icons;
     - fakesigns every injected binary for sideloading.


<details>
<summary><b>Code Editor Setup</b></summary>

Theos does not emit a compilation database by default, causing editors to fail at finding the iOS SDK. You can generate one using [`bear`](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear):

```bash
make compile-commands
```

This generates `compile_commands.json`. Re-run this after adding new source files. Note: Logos `.xm` files cannot be fully parsed by clang, so `.clangd` suppresses false diagnostics while ensuring they compile correctly.

**Resilient Hooking:** Each hook dynamically verifies that its target class and selector exist before installation. If a Facebook update changes a specific class, only that single feature degrades safely without crashing the entire tweak. The settings gesture, for example, hooks both the classic tab bar and the new iOS 26 liquid-glass bars so long-press keeps working across iOS versions.

## 📜 Provenance & Credits

- **Idea & Inspiration:** The core concept of this tweak was inspired by the closed-source Facebook tweak **[Glow](https://github.com/dayanch96/Glow)**. This project is a clean reimplementation based on its behavioral analysis.
- **Story & Reels Downloader:** The media download feature (`src/Features/Downloads/`) was contributed by **[ttlongdl](https://github.com/ttlongdl/Facebook-Plus)** via their GPLv3 fork, and is integrated here with attribution as required by the license.
- **"Open in Facebook" Safari Extension:** The bundled Safari web extension (`OpenInFacebookSafariExtension/`, built from source into the IPA) is our own, independently written implementation — its own `NSExtension` host, manifest and link-routing scripts, with no third-party binary or source bundled. See `OpenInFacebookSafariExtension/README.md` for details.
- **Compatibility Layer:** The sideloading compatibility layer (`src/PluginsInject/`) is copied and derived directly from **[zxPluginsInject](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/zxPluginsInject)**.
- **Symbol Rebinding:** Uses **[fishhook](https://github.com/facebook/fishhook)** for dynamic symbol rebinding.
